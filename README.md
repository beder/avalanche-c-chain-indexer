# Avalanche C-Chain Indexer

This project indexes the C-Chain of Avalanche and provides endpoints for accessing information related to blockchain transactions and addresses.

## How to setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
docker compose run --rm api npm install
```

2. Initialize the database

ðŸ’¡ Please note that this command will not exit automatically. You will need to end it manually. Use Ctrl+C in MacOS.

```bash
docker compose run -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust --rm postgres
```

3. Setup the database

```bash
docker compose run --rm indexer npx prisma db push
```

## How to run

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Resetting the database

If you need to start fresh by erasing all indexed data, execute the following command.

```bash
docker compose run --rm indexer npx prisma db push --force-reset
```
